# MagTense

Library for magnetostaic and micromagnetism calculations.

## Features

- High-level interfaces for MATLAB and Python, with the core implemented in Fortran for speed;
- Fully analytical calculation of demagnetization tensor for cylinders, pieces of cylinders, prisms, circular pieces and tetrahedrons;
- Micromagnetic solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equations, using the analytical demagnetization tensor described above;
- (Optional) GPU-accelerated code with [CUDAÂ®](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (requires NVIDIA graphics card).
- Tested in Linux and Windows 11+ (macOS not supported at the moment).

## Installation and usage with the Python interface

Installation is recommended via `conda` package manager (requires >=**Python 3.9**).

- Installation with CUDA 12 (requires NVIDIA graphics card):
  
  ```
  conda install magtense -c cmt-dtu-energy/label/cuda-12 -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.6.3 -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge
  ```

- Installation without CUDA support:

  ```
  conda install magtense -c cmt-dtu-energy/label/cpu -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge
  ```

See also the [examples](./python/examples/) of working with the Python interface.

### Build from source

Detailed instructions for building the Python interface with the Fortran core are available [here](/python/README.md).

## Installation and usage with the MATLAB interface

MagTense is directly useable in Matlab on Windows by downloading the already compiled MEX-files in [Releases](https://github.com/cmt-dtu-energy/MagTense/releases). The files are directly useable with no compilation required, although Matlab 2020b or greater is required.

Examples of how to calculate magnetostatic and micromagnetic problems using the Matlab interface can be found in [matlab/examples](matlab/examples).

### Compilation with a Visual Studio project file

If you want to compile MagTense with a Visual Studio project file for Windows, [MagTense.sln](MagTense.sln), is available, as well as a Matlab function to build the MEX-files, [buildMagTenseMEX.m](matlab/buildMagTenseMEX.m). MagTense utilizes Intel MKL for the micromagnetic simlations and can also utilize CUDA and CVODE.
