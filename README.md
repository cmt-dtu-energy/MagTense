# MagTense initial version 2019
#
# MagTense consists of both a magnetostatic and a micromagnetism calculation framework
#
# The magnetostatic framework is fully implemented in Fortran and has a Matlab MEX interface, as well as python interface (in progress)
#
# The micromagnetism model currently only exists in Matlab, but utilizes the magnetostatic framework for calculating the demagnetization tensor.
#
# Examples of how to calculate magnetostatic problems can be found in matlab\examples .
#
# The micromagnetism code is currently in full development. An initial example is file "Script_3D_TestDynamicsStdProbl4.m" in the micromagnetism folder.
#
# Currently the code is in massive development. The main features being worked on at the moment are:
# - Proper code documentation
# - Example code for both Matlab and python
# - A transfer of the micromagnetism model to Fortran
