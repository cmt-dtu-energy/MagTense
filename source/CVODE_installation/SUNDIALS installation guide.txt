Install cmake
Download sundials-4.1.0
Unzip sundials-4.1.0
It is not possible to get the cmake installer to work if sundials is unzipped in a directory with spaces.

Rename the folder sundials-4.1.0/sundials-4.1.0 to sundials-4.1.0/srcdir
Make a new folder sundials-4.1.0/builddir
Make a new folder sundials-4.1.0/instdir

Open the file "scrdir\config\SundialsFortran.cmake" in Notepad and change the following two lines to:
214     "FIND_FILE(FLIB flib.f ${FortranTest_DIR})\n"
262     "FIND_FILE(FLIB flib.f ${FortranTest_DIR})\n"

Open Visual Studio and open a Developer Command Prompt (Tools/Command Line/Developer Command Prompt)
cd to the builddir
Do: "C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake-gui.exe" ../srcdir
Click "Configure"
	Choose Visual Studio 16 2019 (or whatever latest version you have) as generator
	Write "Intel C++ Compiler 19.0" (or whatever latest version you have) in "Optional toolset to use"
Set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the full path to the instdir
Set the EXAMPLES_INSTALL_PATH to the full path to the instdir/examples
Enable only the following settings (if not all settings appear, select the appropriate onces and click "Configure" again):
	BUILD_CVODE
	BUILD_STATIC_LIBS
	BUILD_TESTING
	EXAMPLES_ENABLE_C
	EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CXX
	EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F77
	EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F90
	F2003_INTERFACE_ENABLE
	F77_INTERFACE_ENABLE
	OPENMP_ENABLE
Click "Generate" in cmake
	(if any paths contain spaces or parentheses, escape the offending symbols with \ and generate again. Likely culprit: BLAS libraries.)

Now copy build_rest.bat into builddir and run it in the command window.

In the command window run "msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj -property:Configuration=Debug"
In the command window run "msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj -property:Configuration=Debug"

In the command window run "msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj -property:Configuration=Release"
In the command window run "msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj -property:Configuration=Release"

CVODE is now installed in the instdir

Copy the instdir to "C:\Program Files (x86)\sundials-4.1.0" (as well as the builddir and srcdir) 

Notes:
The last four instructions *could* be put into the .bat file, but it's easier to isolate warnings/errors if they aren't.
Building ALL_BUILD causes two linker warnings because SUNDIALS gave compile flags to the linker as well as the compiler.
Building INSTALL can cause one (strange) warning, MSB8065, which is apparently a bug of no consequence (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/19737)
