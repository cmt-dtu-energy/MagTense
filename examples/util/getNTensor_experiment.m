%% tiles is an array of length m consisting of the tiles that produce the
%% field at the n pts ( (n,3) array )
%% returns N which is a matrix size (3m,3n) that works like this:
%% N dot M = H, where M is a column vector size 3m with the magnetization
%% components of each tile and H is a column vector with the field
%% components at each measured point.
function [N] = getNTensor_experiment( tiles, pts )

%get the no. of tiles
m = length( tiles );

%get the no. of measured points
n = length( pts(:,1) );

%Make the output matrix
N = zeros( 3*n, 3*m );



%loop over each tile
for i=1:m
    
    N_ = getNFromTile_mex( tiles(i), pts, int32(n) );
    for j=1:n
        N( (j-1)*3+1:j*3, (i-1)*3+1:i*3 ) = squeeze( N_(j,:,:) );
    end
