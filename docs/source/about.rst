Development of the code and the associated research on permanent magnets 
is sponsored by the Poul Due Jensen Foundation, in a project aimed to 
understand the coercivity of permanent magnets. Furthermore, development 
is also sponsored by the Independent Research Fund Denmark project, 
contract. no. 7017-00034.

Previously the development of the demagnetization part of the framework 
has been partly financed by the ENOVHEAT project, which is funded by 
Innovation Fund Denmark (contract no. 12-132673), and also the Programme 
Commission on Energy and Environment (EnM) (contract no. 2104-06-0032) 
which was part of the Danish Council for Strategic Research.
